 *Responsible for doing recursion. 
 * Method called placeQueen() is what looks around to see if it has a neighboring queen. 
 * Uses a two dimensional array. 8 rows and 8 columns.
 * Would need a loop construct. 4 loops to check whether or not it can be attacked.
 * Prof recommends doing a nested for loop.
 * board being equi. to marks. 
 * To check diagnal, its going to take a nested for-loop.
 *  return true;
 * for(int column = 4; column <  board[3].length; column++)
